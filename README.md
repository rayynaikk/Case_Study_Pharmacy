The Product Team is considering a change in February 2024 whereby we increase the visibility of the feature that allows customers to add additional, non-medication items to their cart during the checkout process. 



Background:

You are an analyst for an online pharmacy. The companyâ€™s customers use our online app to order prescription medications, and the company delivers those medications to the customer via courier.

Like most online e-commerce apps, customers interact with the app by adding items (prescription medications, in this case) to a shopping cart. When the customer is ready, they go through a checkout process to place an order for the items in their cart.
During the checkout process, we recently added a feature that allows customers to add additional, non-medication items to their cart (for example, vitamins or Band-Aids). These non-medication items get ordered along with the rest of the cart during checkout, and they are delivered via courier together with the rest of the items in the cart.

Case

The Product Team is considering a change in February 2024 whereby we increase the visibility of the feature that allows customers to add additional, non-medication items to their cart during the checkout process. The Product Team believes the change will result in 20% of customers who complete the checkout process will order non-medication items along with the rest of their cart.

As the analyst supporting this initiative, you are responsible for estimating the expected impact of this change.
